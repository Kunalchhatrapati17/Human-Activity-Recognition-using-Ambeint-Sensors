# Human-Activity-Recognition-using-Ambient-Sensors
# Description:-
This dataset comprises ambient data collected in homes with volunteer residents. Data are collected continuously while residents perform their normal routines.

# Link of the dataset:-
https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/506/human+activity+recognition+from+continuous+ambient+sensor+data

# Files used in this code:-
1. output.csv is the dataset file that we have used over here. It comprises 419887 records.
2. File-2.csv is used to load the data.
3. output-1.csv is used to store the data.

# Steps performed in this code are as follows:-
1. Data Processing steps.
2. ML Classification is performed in this step, where we have performed analysis using 5 ML models.
3. Evaluation and Analysis of each & every model.
4. Comparison of every ML model is shown in comparison of every ML model file, which would have accuracy, precision score, and recall values of every ML model.
5. This project is approved by IEEE and here is the link of the research paper:- https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10323956
